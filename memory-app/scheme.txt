React Memory Powerful Web App

components
title X
options button with popup menu
settings buttons
save settings button
generate sequence button

next set button
seq display field
guess field
submit guess field
display when user should guess


IDEAS
streamlined,
so after you input settings and generate seq, 
there is a button to enter the gauntlet,
tells current settings below button,
and it basucally goes zenmode,
where spacebar gives next set,
and thats all on screen.
then it switches to say guess and shows text field, 
after text is entered, then submit button apears,
after submision, score is shown
refresh to restart MVP

TODO WAY LATER
make a save settings to profile button, using like several presets that are saved in cookies so people can train on their particular problem

toggleable timer, records time spent memeorizing, time spent recalling

next set isnt button activated but time activated after duration in seconds (add setting), 

toggleable progress bar

save reesults button appears lol
